General notes:

This mod does several things:

1. It overwrites the vanilla censored German flag with the uncensored flag.
2. It creates three cosmetic tags, one for each flag.
3. It uses three events to change between the flags, depending on your diplomatic status.
4. It uses a fourth event to give you the ability to switch the War flag mid-war.

Dev notes:

This was sadly not a simple measure of copy and paste, though it should work.

__Theoretically__ this should also work with everything that doesn't specifically modify the added files.
Which means: It's compatible with 'Beautiful States'.

Bear in mind:
Vanilla ideologies are volatile, so this mod might, at least lore-wise, break.
